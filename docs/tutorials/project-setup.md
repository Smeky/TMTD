# Project setup

## Node.js
First install the latest **"Recommended"** version - https://nodejs.org/en/. Once done, try running to see if it's all ok
    
    npm --version


Next I'd recommend to install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) as a alternative package manager.

    npm install --global yarn


## Dependency installation
Install node_modules

    yarn install

And to see if it went ok

    yarn start

Then go to http://localhost:8080/. If the page loads up, it works :)
